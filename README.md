BrainFood
=========
Got a hunger for knowledge?  So does [#iubrain](https://twitter.com/iubrain).

Example App
-----------
`app.html` uses `app.js` and HTML5's geolocation API to find the user's latitude and longitude, and calculate the distance between you and the #iubrain.

Brainstorming Additional Functionality
--------------------------------------
This is a *minimally* functional example.  But in theory it would be easy to add:

* "Achievements" i.e. touched the brain (dist < 1m)
* opt-in publish data (anonymously or not, to IU or worldwide, etc.)
* opt-in link with social media accounts
* unit conversions meters to light-years, neuron length, alpha wave length, ... (could go crazy with this)
* ???
* Profit!

Other
-----

1. If you make something non-trivial in JavaScript you're gonna have a Bad Time.  Choose something better (React.js or Elm) if we decide to get serious.
2. Make it beautiful (by today's standards).
3. Other possible targets: Chrome App, Native App (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)
