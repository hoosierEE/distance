Got a hunger for knowledge?  So does [#iubrain](https://twitter.com/iubrain).

Example App
-----------
`index.html` is an HTML5 app, which uses JavaScript (`app.js`) and the geolocation API to find the user's latitude and longitude.  It then does some math to find how far the user is from the #iubrain.
