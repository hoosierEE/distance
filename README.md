Where is Brain? There is Brain!
===============================
IU Brain is on a plane!

Got a hunger for knowledge?  So does [#iubrain](https://twitter.com/iubrain).

Example App
-----------
Uses HTML5's geolocation API to find the user's latitude and longitude, and calculate the distance between you and the #iubrain.

Features:
* shows distance and orientation (if available)
* pretty colors

TODO
----
Make sure orientation calculation is correct!
